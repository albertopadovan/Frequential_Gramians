# Frequential_Gramians

In this repository we provide the scripts used to generate the results in section 5 of the paper [Padovan, A. and Rowley, C.W. "Continuous-time balanced truncation for time-periodic fluid flows using frequential Gramians," arXiv:2208.13245](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13245.pdf). In particular, Algorithm 1 in the manuscript is implemented in the function `compute_matrix_X_alg1` in the file <code>balancing_functions.py</code>

## Dependencies
- Python modules `numpy` `scipy` `time` and `matplotlib`
