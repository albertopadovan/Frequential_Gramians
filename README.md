# Frequential_Gramians

In this repository we provide the scripts used to generate the results in section 5 of the paper Padovan, A. and Rowley, C.W. ``Continuous-time balanced truncation for time-periodic fluid flows using frequential Gramians,'' arXiv:2208.13245. In particular, Algorithm 1 in the manuscript is implemented in the function `compute_matrix_X_alg1` in `balancing_functions`

## Dependencies
- Python modules `numpy` `scipy` `time` and `matplotlib`
