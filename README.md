# Frequential_Gramians

In this repository we provide the scripts used to generate the results in section 5 of the paper [Padovan, A. and Rowley, C.W. "Continuous-time balanced truncation for time-periodic fluid flows using frequential Gramians," <i>J. Comp. Physics<\i>, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999123006927?via%3Dihub). In particular, Algorithm 1 in the manuscript is implemented in the functions `compute_matrix_X_alg1` and `evaluate_gramian` in the file `balancing_functions.py`.

## Dependencies
- Python modules `numpy` `scipy` `time` and `matplotlib`
